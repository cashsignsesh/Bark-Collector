			Dog food will cause food to fall from the screen every 10 times you or a robot dog clicks on the main dog.
			The amount of food that falls from the top of the screen is equivelent to 1 + (your amount of dog food/10)
			rounded down. After touching the dog food with your mouse, excrement will randomly appear on the screen 4
			seconds later. When collecting excrement by touching it with your mouse, you will gain 2 + (your friends*2)
			barks. When collecting dog food, you will gain 10 + ((your amount of dog food*2)-your friends) barks.
